# T1A3-Terminal_application

Introduction
Terminal applications, also known as command line applications (or apps for short), are run from the shell and accept input from stdin and arguments such as flags and options, and produce an output that is useful to the user.

You will create your own terminal app because:
- terminal applications are an essential part of learning to utilise the functions of all operating systems efficiently and in a way that promotes your understanding of the inner workings and processes of operating systems and the hardware itself

- many applications used across IT functions utilise terminal applications as a standard, rather than applications with a graphical user interface;

- developing your own terminal application will increase your technical sophistication and ability to use other terminal applications.

Brief
- You are to design, implement and test a terminal application and throughout the process demonstrate that you are able to use a range of developer tools.

The mandatory requirements/constraints for your application are:
- accept user input in the form of a file or text input

- produce printed output or interact with the file system

- You must get your Educators approval for your app idea prior to working on the software development plan or implementing the application itself

Assessment Instructions
Requirements for this project are divided into two major parts,

1. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
    - Documentation for this project must be supplied as a single markdown file named README.md. This file should contain:

# R1

Answers to all the documentation requirements below.

# R2

Your README.md should have a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.

# R3

Provide full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable).

# R4

Provide a link to your source control repository

- Repository link: https://github.com/LukeZHar/T1A3-Terminal_application

# R5

Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

- Code Style PEP 8 - Style guide for Python Code
    - Reference website: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

# R6

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:

- at least THREE features

- describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- error handling


Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

# R7

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

# R8

Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application


2. CODE REQUIREMENTS:  

# R9

Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:

- variables and variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- write and utilise simple functions

- error handling

- input and output

- importing a Python package

- using functions from a Python package

# R10

Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

# R11

Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

# R12

Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

# R13

Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:

- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes

- pushing all commits to a remote repository

# R14

Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:

For example,

- writing a script which turns the application into an executable
