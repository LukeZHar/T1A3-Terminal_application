## Project Overview

This terminal application allows you to create and manage flashcards through the command line and then quiz yourself on the questions you provided.

### Summary of code and files

- 'flashcards.py':

  - Defines classes 'Flashcard', 'Deck', and 'DeckManager' for managing flashcards and decks.
  - 'DeckManager' includes methods for creating and deleting, saving, loading decks, and running a quiz.
  - Includes error handling for file operations.

- 'main.py':

  - Contains the main loop for the interface, allowing you to interact with the flashcard system
  - Handles creating, deleteing, selecting decks, adding/viewing flashcards, and running the quiz
  - Ensures error handling for unexpected issues.

- 'test_flashcard.py':

  - Contains tests for the 'Deck' and 'DeckManager' classes using pytest

- 'check_python.py':

  - Uses a command ('python' or 'python3') as an argument to check if its installed
  - Prints the version if it was successful
  - Handles exceptions if command is not found or other errors occur

- 'decks.json'

  - A JSON file containing data for decks and flashcards

- 'requirements.txt':

  - Lists dependecies required by the application

- 'run_setup.sh:

  - A shell script for checking if python is downloaded through 'check_python.py', downloading the denpendices from 'requirements.txt' if not installed already, and running the 'test_flashcard.py' tests

- 'run_app.sh':
  - A shell script for running the application, including activating the virtual environment if it exists

## Features and Functions of the application

### Deck Management

#### Create Deck:

- Description: Create a new deck. Input the deck name, verified to avoid duplicates, and then saves as a new JSON file.

- Logic:
  - Prompts for a deck name.
  - Check if the deck name already exists.

  - If it does exist, asks for a different name.

#### Delete Deck:

- Description: Delete an existing deck by specifying its name.

- Logic:
  - Prompts for the deck name.
  - Check if the deck exists in the directory.
